If statemnts:
	single if
	if & else
	multi-branch if: 
	nested if: pre-conditions

Nested If: if condition can be evaluated to multiple scenario

		if(pre-condition){

			if(condition1){
				statement1
			}else{
				statement2
			}	

		}else{
			 statement3
		}


		statement1: precondition & condition1 MUST be true
		statement2: pre-condition MUST be true & condition1 is false
		statement3: precondition MUST be false
