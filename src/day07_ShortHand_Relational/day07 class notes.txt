package name: day07_ShortHand_Relational

warmup tasks:
	1. write a program that can swipe two variables' value by using a temporary variable
			ex:
				if a= 10, b=15

				output:
					a = 15
					b = 10

	2. manually calculate the following code fragements:

                1. int a = 100;
                   int b = -a++ + ++a - a-- * a-- % 2



ShortHand: for numbers. re-assigns the variable
	=: asisgnement
		int a = 5;
			a = 10;
			sout(a); // 10


	+=: addition assignement ( can be applicable to string)
		a = 20;
		a = a + 10;  ==   a+=10


Relational Operators:
	>: greater
		10 > 10 ==> false

	>=: greater or equal

		 10 >= 10 ==> true

	<: less

	<=: less than or equal

	==: equal

	!=: not equal



or logic: either. if either one is true, will return true
	True: at least one condition is true
	False: if both conditions are false

	eiteher prime meber  or   price>= 25


and logic: both. if both conditions are true, will return true
	True: if both conditions are true
	False: at least one condition is false
