		Access-Modifier   specifier   return-type  name  (Parameter){

					code fargments

		}

		Acess modifier: public, protected, private, default

		specifier: static
					static: methods can be called through the class name

							ClassName.method()

		parameter: any dataType

		returnType: void, any dataType
				void: does not return any data
				dataType: method needs return a value



return methods: return-type of the method is not void
