import statement:
		
		import java.util.Scanner;  // scanner was presented in "java.util"

		import java.lang.Double;	// not needed, becasue the class is in java.lang package
		import java.lang.String; // not needed


String class: presented in "java.lang" 
			 any class in "java.lang" package will be imported automatically


		 1. Object. there are two ways of creating object:
		 					1. String literals:
		 							 String name = "Daniel"; // all string literal will be in string pool


 							 2. by using new keyword:
 							 		String name = new String("Daniel");  // everytime when we use new keyword new object in heap will be created


		 		Java Heap: memory location in java where all the objects will be saved at

		 		String pool: special memory location. ONLY for String literl objects
		 					does not create duplicated objects

		2. String is sequences of characters
					"Cat" == "CAT"

					each character in String has reprsentive number called index number

					index number: strating from zero

					String name = "Cybertek 1";
					//index:       0123456789


		3. String is immutable
				once the object is created it cannot be modified
