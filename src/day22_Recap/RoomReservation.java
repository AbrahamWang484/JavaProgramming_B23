2. write a program for the room reservation:
           1. King Bed ==> 120$
           2. Queen Bed ==> 100$
           3.  single Bed ==> 80$

            the program asks the user which bedroom does he/she wants to reserve and calculates the total price, and then the program will ask:
                do you want to reserve another room:
                            if yes ==> repeat the previous steps
                            otherwise return the  total price
