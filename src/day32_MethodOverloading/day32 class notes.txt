Task2:
	1. create a return method called addElement that can add an Inteeger  after the  last index of an integer array

method overloading: multiple methods shares same method name.
					
					Parameter MUST BE different ( either the dataType of parameter or the number of parameter)

					Smae method name different parameters


					advantage:
							1. easy to memorize
							2. easy to read
							3. reusable
							4. flexible
